## What is this
This project scraps events from lagenda.org and sets a rating for each one based on given filter conditions.

## How it works
There are two working modes, "laguna" mode, which scraps events only in San Cristobal de La Laguna and "multiloc" mode, which scraps all events. The late one is still under development and would need a Nominatim local server.

## Future plans
* Update ical file from events.
* Setup proyect in a Docker container.
* Publish ical file in container.
* Setup multiloc mode with Nominatim server.
